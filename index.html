            Hello! My name is Austin Hale and I am a student at Texas A&M University - Commerce at RELLIS. I enjoy software engineering,
            specifically full-stack development and project management. On a more personal side, I also enjoy the outdoors and mountain
            biking. I also am a student researcher for iStar Laboratories working on a cutting-edge blockchain-based 5G cybersecurity
            system for IoT devices. I am currently looking for a software engineering internship to implement and broaden my skillset while 
            creating software that makes a positive change for people and businesses.
